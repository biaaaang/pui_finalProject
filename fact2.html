        <p class="body_text">Let’s imagine that a pathogen (i.e. an entity that causes diseases, such as a virus or a bacterium for example) against which no vaccine is available emerges in a country. Suppose also that no mitigation measures are put in place to limit its spread: no border shutdown, no isolation of people, no testing or quarantine of infected people, etc. Then this country, by allowing this pathogen to circulate freely, will adopt, consciously or not, the strategy of herd immunity.</br></br>

            The idea is relatively simple: most pathogens circulating in a population immunize for a given period of time people who have been infected. Over time, it will therefore become increasingly difficult for the pathogen to find potential hosts in order to spread further. As a result, the population as a whole will be immune even if not every individual is. After the pathogen is gone, if the duration of this acquired immunity is relatively short (a few months or years) and with the renewal of the population through migration and births, the immunization rate in the population will gradually decrease. The risk of the same pathogen re-emergence leading to an epidemic will then increase.</br></br>
            
            A distinction must therefore be made between the immunization rate, which corresponds to the proportion of immunized persons in the general population, and the herd immunity rate, which is a threshold, a target to be met and calculated according to the pathogen’s specific characteristics. The herd immunity rate is a very useful statistical indicator to inform public policy, in terms of vaccination campaigns for instance: which proportion of the population must be vaccinated in order to achieve this collective protection against a pathogen?</br></br>
            
            To ensure that the spread of the pathogen is severely limited and does not cause an epidemic, the immunization rate must be higher than the herd immunity rate at the time the pathogen is introduced into the population. The risk of observing an epidemic reflux, i.e. a second epidemic wave, can also be inferred from this rate, based on the immunization rate of the population following a first epidemic wave. In the case of non-permanent immunity to the pathogen (as it seems to be for SARS-CoV-2), the immunization rate must be closely monitored and population immunity renewed in order to remain above the herd immunity rate at all times, and thus avoid a new epidemic.</br></br>
            
            <b>Warning:</b> herd immunity, as an overall statistical indicator, should not be used at the individual level to determine one’s own risk of being infected at a given location. It would be a reasoning error to calculate an individual risk from aggregated statistics.
