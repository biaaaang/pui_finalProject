2.Description
For my project, I want to build a website about Covid-19 to help people understand it 
better. I want to include an interactive simulation game on the website to show how
the virus spreads among people and how our measures work (wearing
masks/keeping a social distance/having vaccines). I used Jquery, Bootstrap
for my website design and p5 for the simulation game. The target audience is all the people who want to know more about the coid.

3.Using the website
- You can click the navbar at the homepage to get naigated to facts page and simulator page.
- The navbar will stick to the top of the page as you scroll down.
- Click the title to switch into different fact pages.
- On simulatior page, you can choose different simulation modes in the dropdown menu.
- Click Initialise and Simulate/Pause buttons to control the simulator.
- Click the Accordion to see the explanation for different simulation modes.

4.External libraries
- Bootstrap including navbar, menu selector and accorodian to help organize the wabsites.
- JQuery to help add interaction into different pages.
- p5.js to create the canas and build the simulator animation.

5.Iteration from HW7:
- The navbar will stick to the top instead of disappearing when you scroll down.
- Make the Simulate button toggle to make it possible for users to pause the simulation.
- Adding a accordian to help users to understand what is happening.

6.Major challenges:
- Making the navbar visible all the time.
- Learning how to use p5.js.
- Make it possible to switch between different simulation modes.
